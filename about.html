          <h2>A brief history</h2>
          <p>In my 7+ years of designing and developing I've had my hand in many different projects ranging from web apps, mobile apps, websites, branding, front-end development, interactive infographics, video production, illustration and more. I strive to always keep the user in the forefront and to never stop learning.</p>
