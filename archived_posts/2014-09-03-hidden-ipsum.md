I should first say that I love <a href="http://littleipsum.com/" target="_blank">LittleIpsum</a>. It's a great little app that has saved me a decent amount of time since using it.

This week I was performing a test on a form at work and within the message field I posted a quick 4 paragraphs using <a href="http://littleipsum.com/" target="_blank">LittleIpsum</a> and thought nothing about it. A couple days later I was approached and asked where I had obtained the said Ipsum becuase it contained some questionable content.

## Huh?

It appears that one of the people who received the form within the company had actually taken the Ipsum and placed it wihin Google Translate, go figure.

The sample four paragraphs returned the sentence, "The Chinese hate Pakistan" several times within the text. Hmmmmmmmmmm. Along with this phrase it also returned some ramblings about hate. Does Lorem Ipsum have a hidden agenda? Freak accident? 

Odd as it may seem to translate Lorem Ipsum it still seems more odd that it would return these phrases. I compared the app Ipsum to generated text via <a href="http://lipsum.com" target="_blank">www.lipsum.com</a> and I did not see a similar problem occur.

I'll still use my LittleIpsum app but I must question how this content is being generated and hope it doesn't reflect poorly on me.
