This is my attempt to relax, contemplate and then answer two sets of questions in an attempt to Build My Stand and Discover My Passion. What if I find out I'm a terrible person?

## Stand

**What would I do if I knew I only had one year to live?**

Spend as much time as possible with friends and family.

Engage in activities that I love: biking, painting, camping, etc.

Tell everyone close to me how I appreciate and love them.

Travel as much as possible.

Exercise vigorously and meditate often.

Spend time teaching Ingram everything he needs to be successful. 


**What would I do if a natural disaster or terrorist event struck my town?**

I would volunteer time to help others any way that I physically and emotionally could.

**What would I do if a friend asked me to help him move but I really wanted to go see a movie that night?**

For a long time I've tried to treat people how I want to be treated and this situation is the perfect example. I would gladly help.

**What would I do if I found out my favorite brand had been exploiting workers and participating in environmentally destructive practices?**

I would research alternatives and see if there was a better option. 

**What would I do if I won the lottery?**

I would improve my life immediately: new  car, house,etc..

I would ensure that my immediately family is also taken care of as well.

I would give a significant amount away to causes that I believe in.

I would invest to insure that my family and I didn't have to work if we didn't want to.

**What would I do if someone decided to fight me for no good reason?**

I would defend myself to the best of my ability with the goal of containing the person physically so that no harm would be done to me or anyone else around.

**What would I do if an opportunity for an inside deal came my way with no chance of anyone finding out?**

I guess it really depends on the situation? The term inside deal is so broad I don't really know how to respond to this. I'm sure that I'm supposed to say no but I just can't outright do that.

**What would I do if my team were bashing a teammate behind his or her back in my presence?**

I would most likely listen and offer alternatives to talking about someone else and instead focusing on ourselves.

## Passion

**What books, movies, art, or music get you pumped?**

*Books:* The Age of Reason, The Alchemist, Buddhism without Beliefs. Books that offer wise wisdom and help me become a better version of myself without requiring a doctrine.

*Music:* Heavy, fast and passionate.

*Art:* Graffiti, sign Painting, anything done by hand that involves letters.

**Who inspires you and why?**

The Buddha for overcoming the world and finding solace in this world.

Nicholas Moegly. He is a close(ish) friend that has pursued something and excelled tremendously. He makes me want to work harder.

Ingram inspires me, obviously, because he is my creation and makes me focus on something outside of myself.

Anyone who really does what they love as a living and genuinely enjoys life without being fake or bowing down to others.

**What characteristics of yours make you feel great about yourself?**

I'm mentally strong. I have some issues but know how powerful I can be with my mind and I know I can overcome anything I encounter.

My will for continuing along a path and commiting to things like diet, excercise, etc.

**What activities would you do if you had more time and no barriers?**

Continue working on myself to become the best version of me.

Spending as much time with Ingram to do whatever he wants.

Spend more time with others that are close to me.

Camping, riding bikes, painting and drawing, spend more time at Lodge.

**What benefits to others would these activities or characteristics provide?**

I hope that it would make them feel loved and show them how much I enjoy and care about them.

**Could you change the world, making it even a tiny bit better, by focusing more on these?**

That is very possible.

**What would it take to get you to step into the arena of even just one of these activities?**

Time and better health.
