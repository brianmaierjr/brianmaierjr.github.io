Identifying my 5 biggest sources for stress and what I can do about it.

1. Worrying about the future
2. Physical/medical problems
3. Money
4. Work related issues
5. Existential ridiculousness

As of pretty recently I have noticed that I needed an outlet for relieving stress. I have always done lots of excercise to relieve stress but adding meditation to my repertoire I have learned that I can deal with anything. I know how powerful the mind can be and by harnessing calmness I can create a much needed break from my constantly moving brain.

After researching more stress reducers I know that the best thing I can do for myself is analayze the situation. Am I creating the stress myself or is this a REAL situation? What can I do about it? Does it benefit me to stress out about it? 

In addition I plan on drinking the right amount of water and watching my food intake. To make sure this happens I am using the MyFitnessPal app to actively track what I am putting in my body.
