Identifying my 5 biggest sources for stress and what I can do about it.

1. Worrying about the future
2. Physical/medical problems
3. Money
4. Work related issues
5. Existential ridiculousness

I have always done lots of excercise to relieve stress but by adding meditation to my repertoire I have learned that I can deal with anything. I know how powerful the mind can be and by harnessing calmness I can create a much needed break from my constantly moving brain.

After researching more stress reducers I know that the best thing I can do for myself is analayze the situation. Am I creating the stress myself or is this a REAL situation? What can I do about it? Does it benefit me to stress out about it? In addition to taking deep breaths asking myself these simple questions allows me to break throught the stress and live in the moment. I need more living in the moment.

In addition I plan on drinking the right amount of water and watching my food intake daily. To make sure this happens I am using the MyFitnessPal app to actively track what I am putting in my body.
