Figuring out the meaning of optimal health and how to implement it into my lifestyle.

Optimal health to me is ultimately the balance between being mentally, physically and financially stable. It is the dance of implementing techniques and tactics that allow me to constantly progress so that I am constanstly improving and never staying stagnant.

The biggest one in that list is being physically stable. My bodyweight is always fluctuating and with that my emotional stability. My emotional state is often tied directly to how good I feel physically.

What would this look like for me? It would look like me physcially fit with a stable mind and wallet. To do this I would need to continue to eat well and work out. I would need to save more money and become debt free. I would need to keep learning/reading/writing to develop myself mentally. I would need to probably watch less tv, right now it's my way of relaxing but I need to replace it with reading. I used to not own a television because I didn't want to get sucked in but I bought one anyway. I may have to possibly move it to another room......
