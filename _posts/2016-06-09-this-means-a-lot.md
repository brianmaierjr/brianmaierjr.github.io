I asked my closest friends, family and colleagues for honest feedback about my top areas of improvement.

The most positive feedback was basically hearing about my strengths from this close group of friends, family and colleagues. It is always nice to hear something positive even when it is followed by your top areas of improvement ha.

Based on the emails these are the two biggest areas in my life that I need to improve:

1. Honesty - I know that sometimes I can be too brutally honest and it comes off insensitive. I guess I expect others to give me the same feedback but really it just comes off as me being a jerk. Point taken.
2. Confidence - Something I have always struggled with. I'm one of those people who can't "fake it until you make it" I tend to be too honest and put all my insecurites and inabilites out there.

I have generally approached both of these areas with the same philosophy, treat people how you want to be treated. I give people brutally honest feedback because I give myself honest feedback and in return expect that from all my peers. As far as confidence I am only as confident as I feel and I can't fake it or I have trouble looking to positives because it seems like it is just sugar coating the situation.

From this course I've realized there is a delicate balance to life and I have been severely misaligned. Although I am brutally honest with myself I cannot always be that way with other people. If I want to have successful and meaningful relationships then sometimes I have to bite my toungue. In the confidence area I am in the process of becoming more organized and better focused which in return is helping me gain confidence. Getting Things Done has been quite a blessing and continues to help me every day that I use it.

Thanks to everyone who gave me honest feedback, I love you all.
