A self evalution for Module 1 of the Unstoppable Course.

## Summarize the key concepts you've learned

In general I have learned to be more aware of signs along my journey that are positive and negative. In addition to becoming aware I've learned to embrace both and to evaluate how they impact the path that I am on.

I have realized that stepping back and evaluating my passions, values and purpose gives me a clear path that can help me make better decisions and ideally have a better life. 

## Analyze the impact of the daily 5-minute journal activity.

I really embraced the 5 minute journal and paired it with a 7 day gratitude meditation program. Together these tools have helped me embrace all of the good in my life. Before doing this I would often dwell on the negative and having to journal about what I'm thankful for everyday has blown that door down completely. Instead of waiting for impending doom I now start the day embracing the best things about my life.

## Calculate or estimate the time you spent on this module of the course.

I would say I've spent around 15 hours total. I'm sure that I could spend more but for now I'm finding as much time as I can. 

## Evaluate your participation in the activities of this module and how it stacks up against the participation of your peers.

I'm terrible at commenting on other people's posts. I think most of the comments are actually general and a bit unnecessary. Because we are required to participate it waters the responses down. 

## Describe how the topics covered in this module apply to various aspects of your life.

Overall this course is exactly what I need so I'm embracing it and implementing the lessons anywhere that I can. I mostly see them applied to my work life and how I interact with my co-workers.
