Creating an agenda for my soon to be Weekly Review.

1. Go through tasks and mark any that are complete as such.
2. Review tasks to see if any of them need to be bumped up to Priority.
3. Review Projects and organize accordingly.
4. Go through my list of goals and make sure my tasks/projects align.
5. Add new projects to get closer to my goals.
6. Find any next actions for tasks/project that need them.
7. Meditate while picturing what my goals would look like complete.

I plan on doing this review every Friday afternoon or Monday morning. I may try both to see what works best for me. I have to say I'm extremely excited to tackle this because I believe my previouis attempts fell short without a review system like this. 

**UPDATE**

After doing my weekly review I can honestly say I'm surpised at how much progress I've made already. I actually found a couple things that needed to be checked off and wow that felt good. Keeping my goals in Nozbe allows me to allows be on a steady path and I can see nothing but success in this next year.
