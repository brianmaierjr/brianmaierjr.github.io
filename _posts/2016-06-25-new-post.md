I was paying it forward during the middle of this course and I had no idea... Life is funny.

So around the middle of this course I was doing a lot of meditating and seeing some great results. It was at about this time that my best friend Charley was flying oversees for his honeymoon. Charley is a lot like me in the area that we are extremely anxious and worry about things that are far out of our control. I had the pleasure of taking Charlie and his Wife to the airport to catch their plane and while waiting for the plane in the airport we had a great talk via text about his fear of flying. It was then that I was able to channel my unstoppable self and relay some of the things I had been learning to Charley. I'm not 100% sure if it worked but I know that he appreciated the wise words and positive messages I was sending his way.
