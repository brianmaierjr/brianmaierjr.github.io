I took the <a href="https://portal.howtofascinate.com/you" target="_blank">Fascinate Assesment</a> and I'm pleasantly surprised.

I do agree with these results but I feel like a self consumed jerk at the same time. Working in the creative field I have to be creative and I really do believe I have done a great job. It takes a lot for me to say that and it still feels weird. I know that my Passion drives my Innovation but also my desire to learn keeps me engaged and current so that I can be creative on a moments notice.

I believe that these results are perfectly in line with my purpose of creatively expressing myslef in the hopes to teach others. I believe that my goals will help foster these skills and allow them to grow into something larger than myself.
