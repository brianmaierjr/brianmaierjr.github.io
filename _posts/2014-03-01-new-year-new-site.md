Woah. I've finally finished this portfolio and I couldn't be happier.

I may have jumped the gun but I wanted to get it out and see what people think. There is still plenty of work to be done and by pushing it live I'm hoping to have it done sooner than later. Thanks to [this article](https://medium.com/p/f8083e76146d "Stop putting it off and accept the challenge.") I decided to just put up what I have and run with it.

<h2 class="h3">A couple highlights:</h2>

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) powered.
* Hosted FREE on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).
* My first dive into the world of [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), it will not be my last!
* Do you even responsive, bro?
* It's fast.
* Redirect for IE 6-8 users, enjoy it jerks.
* Vertical Rhythm flows oh so smooth.
* [FitText](http://fittextjs.com/) for all the blog headings.
* Semantic grid provide by the [Neatest of Bourbons](http://neat.bourbon.io/).

If you notice anything else that is off or wonky please feel free to comment and as always, thanks for reading.
