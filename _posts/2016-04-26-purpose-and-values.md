## Purpose

I love to be physically active. Ever since a young age I was involved in sports and other activities. After losing 45lbs one summer I realized how important being in shape was. Unfortunately life took hold and now after 10 years, 1 kid and plenty of anxiety I am heavier than ever and starting to work out again.

I desire to be outside in nature. Sitting in this cube now I am longing to be outside on my bike pedaling away. I absolutely love big cities but I also appreciate the natural world that has been given to us. I also recognize that the world revolves around nature and that we need to take care of it as much as possible. 

I really enjoy helping others. I don't particularly do common things like volunteer, etc. but if I see someone in need I get a lot of being the one who stops and helps. I like the idea of doing this behind the scenes instead of making a show out of it as some people do. 

I am a creative. I love making things digitally and especially by hand. I am never satisfied with what I make but I always enjoy the process and am always improving. I am constantly involved in many projects that range from fine art to music to web design. I really enjoy being surrounded by people who are also creative. Growing up all of my friends were musicians and artists and after moving away from my hometown of Cincinnati has me craving being around them again. 

### Purpose Summary

*I intend to always be upon a path of improving myself knowing that I will never be "perfect" while always creatively expressing myself through the arts in an attempt to inspire, help and teach others.*
