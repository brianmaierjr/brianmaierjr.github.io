According to the Resiliency Quiz I am very resilient! How do I feel about this?

I feel great about it. Just like many other people I have been through a decent amount of hardships and have had to overcome many obstacles. I have built myself up from nothing into a successful career and family focused man. I am constantly bouncing back and trying to improve myself. 

I know that I could benefit from more self esteem. I believe that as I continue to become better physically and mentally this will come.
