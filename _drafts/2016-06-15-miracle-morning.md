Crafting my mornings to be better by using The Miracle Morning technique.

To be honest I was doing all of these things already. I have always enjoyed doing meditation and some sort of physical excercise every morning and with the addition of the gratitude journal things feel even better.

I can always notice on days when I don't follow TMM that I seem a little off. It will usually require me to take some time out of my morning at work to meditate or do my gratitude journal just so that I can align myself.

## Reflection

Crafting goals that align with my view of Optimal Health will allow me to continue on this path of success. I will obvioulsy have to revisit my goal list, short and long, to make sure everything is copacetic. In general I never realized how powerful some of these self-help blogs and podcasts are. I need to make an effort to continue reading and researching new methods and ideas from some self-improvement gurus.
