In honor of this unfortunate and sad holiday I offer hope in the form of the greatest touchdown celebration ever.

If you don't know what the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ickey_Shuffle" target="_blank">Ickey Shuffle</a> is then you are either a terrorist or a self-denying Steelers fan. Either way you lose.

The Ickey Shuffle never fails to make me smile and as a long time Bengals fan it reminds me that even though there have been plenty of bad times there have also been some great ones. Enjoy.
