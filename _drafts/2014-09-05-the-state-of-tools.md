One of the best parts of my job is staying updated. The web is constantly changing and with it we must also adapt.

In this adaptation process I come across many new tools/apps/plugins/extensions, whatever you want to call them, daily. Hell, I even made one myself with <a href="http:147colors.com">147 Colors</a>. I test out as many of these tools as I can and very rarely do they obtain a spot in my daily workflow.

I recently read Frank Chimero's article <a href="http://frankchimero.com/blog/no-new-tools/" target="_blank">No New Tools</a> and I have to say I agree with the sentiment of this article. In it Frank pleads that we stop making tools for the sake of making them and that we focus on the underlying methodology and ideology behind what we do and how we do it. He sums it up best here:

<blockquote>I donâ€™t want a new app to help me do work; I want different ways to think about work so I can get more done.</blockquote>
