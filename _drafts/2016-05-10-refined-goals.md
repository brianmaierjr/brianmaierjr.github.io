Reducing my goals to two lists of 7-10 in hopes that I'll actually work on some them.

## Purpose Statement
I intend to always be upon a path of improving myself while always creatively expressing myself through the arts in an attempt to inspire, help and teach others.

## Short Term Goals
1. Lose 25 lbs. in 6 months (November 10th, Ingram's birthday).
2. Become Debt free by 2017.
3. Read a book every month.
4. Make art by hand once a month as a gift to different friends and family.
5. Write one song a month and post online.
6. Get 7 or more hours of sleep a night consistently.
7. Meditate every day for 5 minutes minimum.
8. Ride my bike to work everyday even when it rains (excludes thunderstorms).
9. Consistently keep using gratitude journal.

## Long Term Goals
1. Move to Cincinnati.
2. Buy a House or Build a Tiny House.
3. Arrange a yearly family vacation.
4. Learn more about my family history from uncle.
5. Meet a beautiful, creative woman who wants to have kids and a future with me.
6. Get a new car.
7. Spend time at a monestary.
8. Save $10,000.

### What is going to hold you back from achieving these Goals?
1. **Time** - Keeping a tighter schedule and always being active will help me combat this.
2. **Determination** - If I can create a *system* where I am constantly reminding myself of these goals I think I can stay determined and see results.
